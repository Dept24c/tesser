# tesser.hadoop.demo

A simple project that runs a character-counting fold. Take a look at
project.clj and src/tesser/hadoop/demo/core.clj for the code, since the
packaging requirements for a Parkour project are a little tricky to get right.
This project.clj is set up for a Hadoop 2.0 Cloudera 4 cluster; you'll probably
want to choose the Hadoop client version appropriate for your environment.

## Usage

Before working with Tesser and Hadoop, make sure that `hadoop jar whatever.jar`
works correctly. You'll probably need to authenticate by running `kinit`.

We need some text files in HDFS to read, and a temporary directory in HDFS to write results to. First, we'll make sure that directory is empty:

```
hadoop fs -rm -r /tmp/kingsbury/demo
```

Then, we'll package the demo project as a fat jar:

```
lein do clean, uberjar
```

Then we'll run that jar in Hadoop against our temp dir and input files:

```
hadoop jar \
  target/tesser-hadoop-demo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar \
  hdfs:/tmp/kingsbury/demo \
  hdfs:/data/foo/0_1/part-*
```

Tesser automatically generates a short random job name and submits it to the
cluster. Stderr looks like:

```

And stdout: a frequency distribution of characters in the input text.
